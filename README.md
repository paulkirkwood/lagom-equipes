# lagom-equipes

Lagom sampler

# Goals

1. Implement some of the theory in "Scala Reactive Programming" into a simple project:

- An API to describe countries - their names and three character ISO codes
- An API to describe a cycling team, "equipe" in French, and which country it is based in.

2. Gain experience of Lagom, Cassandra and potentially Kafka.
